            notwithstanding any termination of this relationship for any reason,
            Paylode shall remain entitled to recover Chargebacks and Chargeback
            Costs (and, where relevant, from any entity who has provided Paylode

            unreasonable. Paylode can recover fines from User in the same way as
            Chargebacks and in any event they represent an immediate liability
